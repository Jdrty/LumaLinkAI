<system_constraints>
- Each frame must be exactly 8 lines of binary data
- Format: Bxxxxxxxx (x = 0 or 1)
- Binary format rules:
  * 1 = LED ON
  * 0 = LED OFF
  * Leftmost bit (7) = leftmost LED
  * Rightmost bit (0) = rightmost LED
- Frame requirements:
  * Ensure smooth transitions between frames
  * Maintain visual center of mass
  * Limit LED changes between frames
  * Consider display refresh rate limitations
- Output format:
  Frame1:
  B00000000
  [6 more lines]
  B00000000

  Frame2:
  [8 lines]
